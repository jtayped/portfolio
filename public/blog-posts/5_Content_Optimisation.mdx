## Content Formatting

Writing appealing blog entries that readers will want to read requires careful formatting. It can help to break up lengthy sections of text, making the information less daunting and simpler to comprehend. Using headings, subheadings, bullet points, and illustrations are effective formatting approaches that make the information easier to skim and more aesthetically pleasing.

One of the metrics that describes user's disinterest is _bounce rate_, which is the percentage of users who exit a website after visiting only one page. It can be reduced by formatting the text on a website optimally, encouraging users to stay on your site longer with engaging and simple-to-read content. This improves a website's search ranking by informing search engines that the material contained within is significant and helpful.

The duration of a blog post can significantly impact visitors' time on a website and their decision to return to read more of the website's content. If a blog entry is excessively long, visitors could rapidly lose interest or feel overloaded which could stop them from visiting your website altogether. This can have a detrimental effect on search engine results and is referred to as a _high bounce rate_. However, if the content is too brief, users may believe that they are not being provided with enough information and may choose to stop reading altogether. A blog article should be around 1,200 words since this gives visitors just enough information to keep them interested without going overboard.

A problem that arises when trying to write content for a website is integrating keywords, and the forced tone that it provides. This problem appears when writers prioritize keyword placement at the cost of overall readability and engaging tone, moreover, the content may sound robotic or stiff.

## Multimedia Usage

Search engines collect information about images' topics from the page's content, including captions and image names. Naming a file according to its contents can provide Google with a few hints about the image's subject matter, so when feasible, utilise short yet descriptive filenames. _My-brother.jpg_, for example, outperforms _IMG000087.JPG_. When possible, avoid using generic filenames such as _picture.jpg_, _1.gif_, and _image.jpg_.

_Alt text_ is the most significant feature for giving extra metadata to an image, it is the text that describes the appearance and content of an image. It also improves accessibility for individuals who cannot view pictures on websites, such as users who use screen readers or have low-bandwidth connections.

## User Intent and Content Relevance

When a user types a query into a search engine, their purpose or objective is referred to as user intent in the context of SEO. Put more simply, it is the "why" that informs the "what". By utilising keyword variants, website owners may reach a wider audience and enhance the visibility of their content.

Keyword variants are the many ways that consumers might ask a certain question. If a website's main keyword is "vegan recipes", for example, some possibilities may be "plant-based meal ideas", "vegan dish recipes", or "easy vegan meals". By including these variants, a website may serve a wider range of users and understand their diverse intents.

Search engines are improving; thus, smart content strategists are beginning to place more emphasis on subject clusters than keywords. Topic clusters are what they use to structure their writing and establish credibility. We have pillar pages, content clusters, and subtopics.

## User Experience (UX) and Content Accessibility

A text's readability is affected by both its typography and substance, such as how sophisticated the vocabulary is. The art of arranging letters to create intelligible and visually appealing written text is known as typography. Typography was a specialised field before digitalization took hold, but now, everyone needs to deal with it, at least, those who own or manage a website. The choices used in typography include font family, font size, line length, and letter and line spacing.

It is important to guarantee that everyone has equal access to experiences, information, and locations, both real and digital. And that is the main idea behind accessibility. Websites that are accessible improve user experience by giving people with disabilities equal access to read, navigate, and engage with online material. They can use it to independently access information, make purchases, and interact with internet services. To improve a website's accessibility a few techniques can be used, such as using descriptive and relevant page titles, using appropriate header hierarchy to organise information, creating a sitemap, using descriptive and relevant anchor tags for hyperlinks, adding alternative text to images for users with screen readers, etc.
