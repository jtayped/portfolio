The process of optimizing a website for search engines to achieve a higher rank is known as search engine optimisation (SEO). Higher rankings can result in more organic traffic to a website since organic search is one of the ways people find information online.

Technical and content strategies are both a part of SEO, which aims to meet the requirements of the top search engine algorithms. High-quality content creation, content optimisation for certain keywords, and link development are frequent SEO practices.

## Objectives and Benefits of SEO

Enhancing the visibility of a website in online search results is pertinent to enable it to generate more leads and sales. In other words, SEO's goal is to help a company's internet presence development. It enables a company to achieve that objective by reaching more qualified leads or clients who are interested in its goods and services.

The success of a website can be measured by these three pillars:

1. **Visibility** : it measures a website's prominence in organic search results for queries input into search engines. It is a guide that enables problem analysis and optimisation.
2. **Traffic** : people who discover a website through a search engine, such as Google or Bing, are considered traffic. The search engine displays webpages that match their keywords once they perform a search.
3. **Conversions** : actions that result in a user being transformed from a visitor or prospect to a client, for example, making an online purchase or signing up for a newsletter. The conversion rate is frequently calculated in order to assess the effectiveness of SEO or advertising campaigns.

A company makes sure that its website is search engine optimised so that it appears as high up in the search results as possible. Greater website traffic results in greater sales and conversions. These are some of the benefits incorporating SEO practices into marketing strategy can bring:

1. **Increased Revenue:** making money and producing a positive return on investment are the ultimate objectives of any business. Websites that are simple to use and perform well in search engine results are more likely to convert visitors into paying clients.
2. **Low-cost Conversions:** an increase in conversions should be noticed once the traffic and the quality of it have both grown. When compared to paid advertising, SEO is a more affordable tactic that targets both internet users who are actively looking for particular goods or services as well as those who may not yet be interested.
3. **Improved Credibility:** users frequently consider websites that are listed on the top page of search engines to be more reliable and trustworthy. Users typically have trust in search engines to deliver accurate and timely results. High-ranking websites are regarded as industry leaders, which helps to build their credibility and reputation.
