SEO, or search engine optimisation, usually entails making minor adjustments to various elements of a website. When coupled with additional optimisations, these adjustments might have a notable effect on the user experience and performance of a site in organic search results, even though they may appear as modest gains when evaluated alone.

## On-Page SEO Optimization

On-page SEO is the process of making a webpage's content appealing to users and search engines. Optimising for search intent, title tags, keywords, and URLs are common on-page SEO practices.

The motivation behind a user's query in a search engine is referred to as search intent, which represents the information that the user is looking for. To determine if a page meets a user's search intent, search engines like Google thoroughly examine the content of the page and show it to the user depending on different factors, like:

- **Content Relevance** : whether the content matches the user's query.
- **Content Quality** : content that is informative, well-written and authoritative.
- **Site structure** : the overall organisation and clarity of the content on a page.

To have relevant content, keyword research must be done. Keyword research entails locating and examining the terms and expressions people use to search for information online. Understanding the keywords that apply to an industry can help optimise a page's content to draw in visitors who are more interested and boost conversion rates. Notably, around 95% of all search queries receive fewer than 10 monthly searches, underscoring the need to carefully choose the most pertinent keywords to increase online presence.

Another important aspect to look out for is creating compelling title tags and meta descriptions. The title tag ultimately determines the name of a search result on search engines. Google automatically chooses the title link from a variety of sources, but most importantly from the '_\<title\>_' element that should be located on each page of the website. As for meta descriptions, they are used as "snippets" which are the summary or description portion of a search result on Google Search. To determine the snippet, Google relies on a variety of resources, including the description provided in each page's meta-description element, to choose the relevant snippet automatically.

Search engines assess the structure of the content on a website, using header tags. They provide a hierarchy and context for search engines like Google to analyse. In addition to making websites more user-friendly by making the information more legible and accessible, header tags are crucial for SEO since they assist Google in comprehending the content.

## Off-Page SEO Strategies

Off-page SEO refers to SEO strategies used to raise a website's rank outside of the website itself. These strategies frequently involve things like link development, reputation management, social media marketing, and more. Off-page SEO aims to increase the trust and authority that visitors and search engines place on a website.

Backlinks are inbound connections from other trusted websites that are crawled and indexed in search engine results pages. Google and other search engines use backlinks as referrals, in essence, when one website links to another, that website is vouching for it. Because of this, Google frequently ranks pages with lots of backlinks higher. Particularly if the backlinks are from reliable, reputable sites.

In SEO, reputation management is the process of ensuring that a searcher's impression of a brand after seeing it in the search engine results pages is favourable. Online reputation management is crucial for SEO because, regardless of how well a website ranks if users have a poor impression of its brand, it will be difficult to attract clicks. It is unlikely that a strong call to action in a page title would be enough to attract a click if there is dissatisfaction with the brand.
