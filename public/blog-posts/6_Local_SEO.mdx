The process of making a company more visible in local search results is known as local SEO. Choosing relevant local keywords, enhancing a company's Google Business Profile, and generating reliable NAP citations are important techniques. It is a crucial procedure for companies looking to boost localised traffic, leads, and brand recognition.

## Google My Business Optimization

When a user searches for a company or area nearby, local results are shown throughout Google in locations like Maps and Search. For instance, if a user searches for "Italian restaurant" on their mobile device, they will most likely get local results.

The most appropriate outcomes for each search are prioritised in local results. It is simpler to match businesses with precise and comprehensive information with the appropriate searches. As a company evolves, it is critical to maintain accurate information. For users to know what a business does, where they are, and when they may visit, they need to make sure to provide all relevant business information on their business profile.

Customers can rate particular elements of their experience when they write reviews for a service. The Business Profile will display these ratings after they have been gathered. The number of positive ratings divided by the total number of ratings yields the combined ratings for a business.

New clients can establish connections with a business through postings that can be made public on Google Search and Maps from a Business Profile.

## Local SEO Analytics and Reporting

A local SEO campaign's success is often defined by its ability to deliver more relevant traffic and leads to a business, raise brand recognition and exposure, and, eventually, lead to more income.

There are several Google My Business metrics to consider, but the following are the most important ones including, for example, engagement, page views, and customer actions. Another important metric to look at is customer ratings, knowing that a business has received reviews is a positive indicator, but it is also vital to understand how many reviews there are and the general review sentiment.
