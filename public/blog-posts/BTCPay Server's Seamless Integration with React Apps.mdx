In the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency, adaptation and innovation are key. BTCPay Server, originally conceived by Nicolas Dorier in response to BitPay's actions during the 2017 Blocksize Wars, has evolved into one of the most popular self-hosted payment processing solutions for Bitcoin users. It's not just small e-shop owners who rely on it anymore; even major players like Namecheap and CheapAir have transitioned from centralized payment processors to self-hosted BTCPay instances. In this article, we will delve into how BTCPay Server has made its mark and why the recent integration with React applications is a game-changer.

## The Evolution of BTCPay Server

From its humble beginnings, BTCPay Server has grown into a robust, versatile payment processing stack. It offers seamless integration with various major merchant platforms, including WooCommerce, Shopify, WordPress, and its own Greenfield API for custom solutions. With user-friendly wallet management, support for on-chain hot and cold wallets, and even Lightning support (requiring users to source their liquidity), BTCPay Server covers every aspect of Bitcoin transactions that merchants desire.

One standout feature is its support for Payjoin and Wabisabi coinjoins, enhancing privacy and security for users. Whether you're running a pre-packaged platform or starting from scratch, BTCPay Server's "BTCPay Button" simplifies the integration of basic receive functionality into any web project. It involves just a few configuration settings on the BTCPay Server side and a few lines of code pasted into your project.

## The Challenge of React Integration

While BTCPay Server provides code snippets that can be easily incorporated into HTML and PHP projects, the challenge arises when integrating with JavaScript React applications. React is one of the most widely used web frameworks for developers, yet there hasn't been a straightforward out-of-the-box integration solution for it.

## Enter Ant and TC

Ant, known for TimechainStats, and TC, the creator of Timechain Calendar, recognized this gap and decided to take action. Both were working on React applications and faced the daunting task of refactoring BTCPay's frontend code to align with React's principles.

Their solution? The React BTCPay Pay Button. This innovation is a complete reimplementation of the standard Pay Button for React applications. It offers a single component that can be effortlessly embedded into any React project, enabling full customization without the need to tinker with BTCPay Server settings. Just insert the button, connect it to the server, and you can customize everything from the application side.

## The React BTCPay Pay Button in Action

Ant, one of the creators, explains it best: "TC and I wanted to build a simple way for other React devs to seamlessly integrate the BTCPay Pay Button into their apps, inspired by our initial attempts with Timechain Calendar and TimechainStats. Now, with just two props — the Store ID and Domain — any React app can fully integrate BTCPay Pay Button. It's a native implementation that fills a crucial gap for React developers."

This component excels in customization, aligning perfectly with React's principles. It's especially handy for donations or tip jars, simplifying the integration process while offering the freedom to tweak UI elements as needed.

## A Bright Future for React Integration

Before the React BTCPay Server Pay Button, integrating BTCPay functionality into React apps required extensive custom development. This new addition makes the process as effortless as integrating the vanilla BTCPay Pay Button into HTML or PHP projects.

What's more, there are rumors that Nicolas Dorier plans to officially incorporate this feature into the BTCPay suite. While it may seem like a minor project in the grand scheme of things, it will significantly streamline BTCPay integration for future developers, reducing the time and effort required.

This open-source initiative embodies the spirit of the cryptocurrency ecosystem, where collaboration and innovation drive progress.
