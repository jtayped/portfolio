## Ethical SEO Practices

Ethical SEO, often known as White Hat SEO, is a method of increasing website exposure and ranks by using ethical tactics. This strategy emphasises giving value to consumers while adhering to search engine criteria. On the other hand, unethical SEO, often known as Black Hat SEO, depends on manipulative practices that violate search engine guidelines to gain rapid results.

Ethical SEO begins with the creation of high-quality, meaningful, and relevant content that addresses a specific target audience's requirements and interests. Content should be well-researched, educational, and interesting. A good rule of thumb is to avoid attempting to fool search engines and putting in the time, effort, and patience required to obtain a high ranking naturally.

The more backlinks to a website, the higher they rank. This has opened up an opportunity to cheat the system with link farms. They are collections of websites that all link to one another to boost their search rankings. Link farms are similar to Private Blog Networks (PBNs), but the distinction is that PBNs are designed to provide links to websites outside of the PBN, whereas link farms simply connect.

## Data Protection

Europe put into action a firm regulation on data protection back in 2018, intending to put an end to abusive data collection. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is the primary European Union rule that governs how organisations manage the personal data of EU citizens. GDPR applies to all companies, regardless of location, that hold or handle their personal data. If a business processes user data, they have to submit to seven protection and accountability principles:

1. Lawfulness, fairness and transparency
2. Purpose limitation
3. Data minimization
4. Accuracy
5. Storage limitation
6. Integrity and confidentiality
7. Accountability
