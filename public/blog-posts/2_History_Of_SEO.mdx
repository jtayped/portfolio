## Early Days of SEO (1990s-2000s)

Although there is not an official launch date for the Internet, most computer experts agree that it was somewhere in the middle of the 1980s. But SEO was not used until the early search engines started classifying the World Wide Web about ten years later, in the mid-1990s. In the beginning, webmasters would crawl webpages and index the material using a "spider" to index the pages. The material on the website would then be extracted by an indexer, which would subsequently order it based on the terms and phrases used.

The first search engine created was Archie, in 1990 by Alan Emtage, a student at McGill University in Montreal. Archie became a database of web filenames which would match results with the user's queries.

In 1991 the first hypertext GUI browser called "WorldWideWeb" was released to the public, developed within the NeXTStep development environment, developed by computer scientist Tim Berners-Lee while working at CERN. The first website was "nxoc01.cern.ch", later called "info.cern.ch".

Later on, in January 1994, Jerry Yang and David Filo, both electrical engineer graduates, launched a website called "Jerry and David's Guide to the 'World Wide Web'". The Guide was not a searchable index of content, but rather a hierarchy-organized directory of other websites. In April 1994 the website was rebranded to "Yahoo!", which is a backronym for "Yet Another Hierarchically Organized Oracle". Although the yahoo.com domain was established in January 1995, Yahoo! had already accumulated a million hits by the year's end. When Yang and Filo realised their website had enormous business potential, Yahoo! was officially incorporated on March 2, 1995.

## Transition to Google Dominance (Early 2000s)

In 2000, Yahoo made the worst strategic misstep in search history when they teamed up with Google instead of Inktomi to power its organic results. The eventual consequence was that every Yahoo search result said "Powered by Google", introducing the world to their biggest rival and making Google a household name. Until recently, search engines had prioritised on-page content, domain names, and the foundational structure of the site when assigning rankings to websites. However, Google's web crawler and PageRank algorithm revolutionised the way that content is found online. The quantity and quality of external links going to a website were variables that Google considered for both on-page and off-page factors.

## SEO in the Modern Era (2020s)

A major update to the Google Search algorithm was made in 2022 that included new "page experience" metrics as search ranking criteria for websites. A website's capacity to provide consumers with the optimum browsing experience through great website loading speed, responsiveness, and visual stability across desktop and mobile devices is measured by Core Web Vitals.

Additionally, about 50% of people use mobile devices for their searches. The number of cell phones has overtaken that of personal computers in many nations so that makes mobile-friendly websites become essential to have an online presence as a result of that.
