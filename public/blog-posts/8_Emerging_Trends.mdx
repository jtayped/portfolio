## Voice Search Optimization

Voice search optimisation is the practice of increasing a website's presence so that it appears for voice search inquiries. When a consumer executes a voice search, the primary aim is to be chosen and/or read out by voice assistants.

Voice assistants such as Amazon's Alexa, Google Assistant, Apple's Siri, and Microsoft's Cortana have changed the way consumers search for information online. This change from text-to-voice queries has had a significant influence on search engine optimisation. Unlike a simple keyword search, a conversational search system can deliver more helpful and complete results by using grammatically complicated sentences and the context of past interactions.

Google launched highlighted snippets to adapt their result pages to mobile and voice searches. The structure of a standard search result is flipped in featured snippets, with the descriptive snippet appearing first.

## AI and Machine Learning in SEO

AI has made immense improvements in a variety of fields, including the field of SEO. As AI technology progresses, it has the potential to disrupt the way search engines work and how businesses optimise their online presence.

One of the primary reasons for the importance of machine learning in search engine rankings is its capacity to improve accuracy. Traditional ranking algorithms used elements like keyword density and meta tags to estimate a webpage's relevancy. In contrast, machine learning algorithms may analyse a wide range of data, including user behaviour, search history, and social signals, to acquire a better understanding of what users are looking for.

Google published SEO and AI-generated content standards, which underlined the significance of openness and ensuring AI-generated content is distinctive and beneficial for readers. Many of Google's principles are also useful for organisations and content providers that work with AI-generated material. For example, content makers should announce when they employ AI to remain transparent and develop customer trust.

AI is crucial in content personalisation, adapting website material to user preferences and requirements. Businesses may give personalised content suggestions by employing AI algorithms that analyse user data such as browsing history, demographics, and search habits.

## Visual and Video Search

Google Lens and Pinterest Lens were introduced in 2017. These applications introduced a revolutionary feature, they let users take or submit a photograph of an object and receive information about it as well as suggestions on related objects.

This is a method of searching whereby an image generates a search query that requires users to post an example image or enter a link to one. In response, the search engine returns the same or comparable images.

Content-based image retrieval (CBIR) powers reverse image search. Images comparable to a particular example image are retrieved from an image database using content-based image retrieval. The search examines the similarity of picture content. The term "content" refers to the colours, forms, textures, and other information that a picture may have.

Traditional picture SEO practices still work effectively to improve the visibility of visual content in search. The objective of image SEO is and has always been to provide search engines with as much information about image content as possible. Recommendable practices include adding visual content to XML image sitemaps, naming images properly and including descriptive alt tags.

## Semantic Search and Natural Language Processing (NLP)

Semantic search takes into account the meaning of words and phrases rather than just the exact keywords employed. This implies that search engines can recognise the context of a search query and deliver more relevant results. It is founded on the premise that words and phrases can have numerous meanings and that the context in which they are used can influence the meaning of a search query.

Semantic search begins by deciphering the meaning of a search query. This is accomplished via the use of several approaches such as natural language processing and knowledge graphs. The search engine uses this information to find the most relevant results after the meaning of the search query is understood. The search engine then ranks the results based on a variety of characteristics, including the relevancy of the material, the quality of the website, and the popularity of the website.

BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a deep learning approach that helps Google comprehend the context of search queries. It uses natural language processing (NLP) to evaluate texts to discover the most relevant keywords and phrases. This allows Google to provide consumers with more accurate and relevant search results. As a result, the pre-trained BERT model may be fine-tuned with only one extra output layer to provide cutting-edge models for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language inference, without requiring significant task-specific architectural changes.
